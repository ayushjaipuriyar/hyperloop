                The number of cars is set to double worldwide by 2040, same with
                air and trucking. We are already dealing with the effects of
                pollution, lack of access, and congestion. If we only invest in
                the same technologies we’ve had for more than a century,
                tomorrow will look like today, only much worse. It’s been over a
                century since the Wright Brothers first showed us human flight
                was possible. It’s time for a new era in transportation capable

              <p class="faq-content">
                Hyperloop is a new mode of transportation designed to eliminate
                the barriers of distance and time for both people and freight.
                It can travel at speeds approaching 700mph, connecting cities
                like metro stops - and it has zero direct emissions. The
                journeys can be booked on demand so there’s no wait time or
                delays.

              <p class="faq-content">
                With hyperloop, vehicles, called pods, accelerate gradually via
                electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The pod floats
                along the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline
                speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag.

                Yes. We’ve successfully run hundreds of tests at our

                  >full-scale prototype</a

                – making transportation history. This test demonstrated that we
                can safely put a person in a near-vacuum environment, and our
                entire safety approach was validated by an independent third
                party.

              <p class="faq-content">
                We estimate that the top speed for a passenger vehicle or light
                cargo will be 670 miles per hour or 1080 kilometers per hour.
                That is about 3 times faster than high-speed rail and 10-15
                times faster than traditional rail. The average speed vehicles
                travel will vary based on the route and customer requirements.

              </summary>
              <p class="faq-content">
                A perfect vacuum would decrease the drag on the vehicle even
                more, but not significantly. We have already gotten rid of 99.9%
                of the air in the tube. Lower levels of vacuum than this are
                important if you are performing scientific experiments, but the
                cost would not be worthwhile.

              </summary>
              <p class="faq-content">
                Hyperloop is an entirely new mode - think the best of trains,
                planes, and the metro. Hyperloop is on-demand, offering flexible
                travel schedules with no stops, no transfers, and no weather
                delays – all at speeds about 3 times faster than high-speed-rail
                and less cost. Hyperloop is highly efficient, with a smaller
                environmental impact than high-speed rail because the closed
                system can be tunneled below or elevated above ground, avoiding
                dangerous at-grade crossings. The VH system is 100% electric and
                can reach higher speeds than high-speed rail for less energy due
                to our proprietary electric motor and low-drag environment.

              <summary>Q. Is hyperloop safe?</summary>
              <p class="faq-content">
                Fast, effortless journeys go hand-in-hand with journeys where
                everything works reliably without interference, and where all
                passengers feel comfortable and safe. The Virgin Hyperloop is
                designed to be inherently safer than other modes, with multiple
                redundancies in place. Our system operates autonomously in an
                enclosed tube and is not susceptible to weather delays,
                accidents from at-grade crossings, human error, or power
                outages. Our proprietary high-speed switching architecture
                eliminates unsafe track configurations and moving trackside
                parts, a failure point of traditional rail with mechanical
                switches.

              <p class="faq-content">
                As new mode, we have to prove our safety case to regulators and
                work with them to develop a regulatory framework, so passengers
                can ride the hyperloop in years not decades. We are encouraged
                by the support we are seeing at the local and federal level
                around the world to support hyperloop certification based on the
                fundamentals of safe operating that are already standard

                States. In the EU, the European Commission (EC) has just
                released the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and
                hyperloop is explicitly identified as a game-changing mobility
                technology. We are also working closely with the European
                Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport
                (DGMOVE) and Shift2Rail to deliver the next wave of sustainable
                mobility through robust regulatory standards. In India, the
                Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Government of India,
                Prof. Vijayraghavan, has set up an independent committee called
                the Consultative Group on Future of Transportation (CGFT) to
                explore the regulatory path for hyperloop. For more, visit our

              <p class="faq-content">
                While flying through a tube at more than 1000km/h might seem
                like a thrill ride, the truth is we are able to mitigate any
                uncomfortable acceleration forces within our controlled
                environment. The journey will be so smooth, you could sip a
                coffee the whole time without spilling a single drop. Normal
                acceleration and deceleration of 0.20 Gs will feel similar to a
                train. As a comparison, flooring a typical sedan gives between
                0.4-0.5 Gs and commercial airplanes see 0.3-0.5Gs depending on
                the plane and load.

                Pods will continue to travel safely to the next portal even with
                a large breach. Our response to a breach would be to
                intentionally repressurize the tube with small valves places
                along the route length while engaging pod brakes to safely
                bringing all pods to rest before it is deemed safe to continue
                to the next portal. A sustained leak could impact performance
                (speed) but would not pose a safety issue due to vehicle and
                system architectural design choices. This assessment is based in
                solid understanding and analysis of the complex vehicle load
                behaviors during such an event.

                Without a massive leap forward, pollution from the
                transportation industry is expected to almost double by 2050 -
                well above the carbon budget. By combining an ultra-efficient
                electric motor, magnetic levitation, and a low-drag environment,
                the VH system can reach airline speeds for 5-10x less energy
                (depends on route length) and can go faster than high-speed rail

              <p class="faq-content">
                We are designing Virgin Hyperloop to be more efficient than
                other modes of transportation. Modern jetliners use up to 10
                times the energy we use per passenger-mile over the entire
                journey. We can cruise at 500 miles per hour for less energy
                (per passenger) than an electric car doing 60 miles per hour. At
                peak speed, the VH system consumes approximately 75 watt hours
                per passenger kilometer (Wh/pax-km). To put this in perspective,
                the fastest conventional maglev train travels at about half our
                speed and consumes 33% more energy.

                Transportation infrastructure has traditionally relied on
                extensive government funding. This is because the benefits of
                clean, safe, and efficient transportation are enjoyed by the
                entire community, not just the user buying a ticket. However,
                most existing mass transportation modes are unprofitable and
                hindered by existing infrastructure built in the past century or
                by legacy systems. We want to change that and are focused on
                public-private partnerships. By developing a new mode of
                transportation from scratch, we're able to leverage
                technological developments that have occurred in the last
                century, especially the IT revolution. We're able to keep
                maintenance costs low, energy efficiency high, and transport
                tens of thousands of passengers per hour. This keeps margins and
                accessibility high, contributing to more financially attractive
                returns than if the corridor was served by existing modes. These
                benefits aren’t just hypothetical. While this is an exceptional
                case due to high demand, a third-party evaluation found that our
                Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop Project could be funded 100% by private
                capital. In the U.S. we see enormous potential to attract
                investment from the private sector, leveraging public
                investments. Involving government stakeholders as well as
                potential private investors early in the project development
